Q: Give an example of you learning a new technology quickly.

A: Learning new technologies has always come naturally to me. For example, I picked up React.js without knowing JavaScript beforehand, leveraging the syntactic similarities with Python. I watched React.js tutorials for nine hours straight and jumped right into building projects, troubleshooting errors through persistent Googling.

During my summer internship, I had to use Firebase as the sole developer on the project. I sought help from ChatGPT (before there was Cursor), asking "How to do CRUD operations in Firebase?" and then adapted the solutions into my codebase.

I'm comfortable learning from documentation or by asking AI for relevant information, using my own reasoning to quickly grasp new concepts.

This ability is thanks in part to the discipline and experience I gained preparing for JEE Advanced 2021.


Q. Why should you hire me?

A. 1) Strong Problem solving skills - Proved by being in top 0.8% in JEE ADVANCE 2021.
   2) Even as a junior SWE, I won't need a specialised document telling me each sub steps I need to complete. A high level description is enough for me - I will figure out rest of the details and a plan on how to convert idea to software.
   3) Love for building cool stuff - I love building cool solutions with software. You pay me 5 LPA or 50 LPA you will get the same quality work from me.
   4) I have previously worked at a early stage startup ( team of 5 ).  I know how small teams function.
